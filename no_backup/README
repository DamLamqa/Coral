About this directory
--------------------

By default, the ESAT backup system backups everything in your home directory, 
except:

 - files/directories (and everything within) called core
 - files/directories (and everything within) called cache or Cache
   Software or hardware developers that develop cache-systems should
   pay attention which file/directory names they use!
 - files/directories (and everything within) called Trash or trash
 - files/directories (and everything within) called no_backup or
   nobackup

Using a no_backup directory allows a user to exclude certain data
from backup. If you have data that is easier to regenerate (or
recopy from the original medium) than to restore it from backup,
you can place it in a no_backup directory.

Because a lot of users don't know this is possible, a no_backup
directory has been created by default in your homedirectory.

So, if you have data that should be excluded from backups, put it in a
no_backup directory (and create a symlink to it if necessary).
